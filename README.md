# Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction
In this project, I have built medical insurance cost prediction using python machine learning. I have used linear regression model for training the data. The dataset used in this project is taken from the kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance).Below are the steps undertaken in the project:
1. Data Collection and pre-processing
2. Data analysis
3. Train test split
4. Model training
5. Model evaluation
6. Building a predictive system
